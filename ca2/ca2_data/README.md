# Programming for Data Science CA2
# Deadline: 4 Feb 2022, 11.59PM
# Requirements
- You must use at least three datasets from data.gov.sg. You can mix the three datasets from any sectors, except from education sector.  You are also allowed to use additional datasets from other websites, e.g. World Bank Data (http://databank.worldbank.org/data/home.aspx)
- Your Jupyter notebook(s) should include the following:
> - Your name and the title of your data analysis
> - The questions you want to answer to gain deeper insights into the chosen datasets such that you are able to craft a ‘storyline’ or produce an interesting data analysis on it
> - A list of URLs of all the datasets you have used
> - For the chosen datasets, explain the nature of the dataset (i.e. what is in the dataset) or any pecularities about it you wish to highlight.
> - Write Python code that uses the pandas package to extract useful statistical or summary information about the data and Python visualisation package to produce useful data visualizations that explain the data. 
> - Highlight the insights you have gained from analysing the data and any conclusions or recommendations you want to make as a result of the analysis
---
- For each dataset you use, you must write a Python codes that uses data visualization package(s) such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc to produce useful graphs / charts that explain the data.
- Your submission should contain the following graphs / chart types:
> - At least one bar chart
> - At least one line chart
> - At least one pie-chart
> - At least one scatterplot
> - At least one boxplot 
- You are highly encouraged to utilise other graph types that may aid in the understanding and analysis of your chosen datasets.
---
- Analysing real-world data is not an easy task.  Reflect on your challenges and your achievements in completing this assignment and document it using the given “Reflection for CA2” template.

### Provide a reflection of the challenges you have faced in this assignment (CA2) with a comparison of those you faced in CA1.  Did you manage to apply any learning experiences from the previous assignment to improve the way you did this assignment?
The challenges I faced to link up all the data to piece them into a storyline and value-added information on the data analysis. Comparing to the assignment in CA1, I manage to draw more conclusion and find more factual data to support my data analysis instead of just presenting the data as per it is. I have also learnt that slicing arrays are quite efficient is obtaining relevant portions of data, as compared to iterating in arrays.
### Provide a reflection of what you think you have personally achieved in this assignment. Do not be shy to highlight extra efforts you have put in for this assignment. This is the place for you to impress upon your tutor on your competency in this area. 
I put in additional effort in reading up more economics and finance articles on how the Gross Domestic Product does being related to the total economy expenditure and R&D cost is one of them. Also, the business factors, for example, The Great Recession implications onto the GDP and hence onto the total R&D expenditure. Also, the various factors that are supported by the data analysis being co-related to the total R&D in a positive or negative linear line. And learning the type of manpower e.g., PHD increased over time and the main element of the type of manpower e.g., Bachelors that make up mainly of the total manpower cost within the total R&D expenditure across the last 8 years.
Aside from doing the programming of the graphs, I learn to do a lot of tables using pivot tables that can be narrow down to many levels of details for data analysis. Also, for me to understand the linear line of the graphs, together with the co-relationship and the factors being few main components contributing to the total R&D as well as the main contributor for the increased R&D across time, I need to read business articles. This enhances my knowledge in business term and how does graphs and data represent the facts that value add to the analysis for future prediction on the liner graphs, and the movement of the factors with the total R&D expenditures.
### What grade do you think you deserve for CA2?  Justify the grade you gave yourself with reasons.

I am a computer engineering student. I attend a lot of programming modules and practice a lot of coding. However, doing this assignment is like a brand-new thing, aside from programming I had to understanding the finance and economic concept, introducing new terms e.g., Gross Domestic Product (GDP) the cause of the up and downs in the economy and the implications of the financial crisis in 2008, and how does the R&D expenditure slowly go back into an upward moving trend having to analysis how does the economy affect spending which R&D expenditure is one of the spending. This assignment requires a business knowledge, hence being a engineering student that has never study finance or economic subjects before, its indeed a challenge. However, I have overcome this and realize how coding, tables and graphs represent data analysis and this data analysis represent the economy movement. Indirectly all the dates, tables and graphs are telling us a “story” on some of the economics behaviors, and hopefully the interpretation of the behaviors will be able to assist in future prediction of the trend which will be very useful for economics or business analyst in business modelling or forecasting. Hence the linkage of the coding and programing which are the specialty of a computer engineering student, with the understanding of the financial and economics information which are the specialty of a business student, will even further enhance our knowledge and bring value add to the society. I have also made my code quite accessible and easy for end-users to customize the code to get other relevant datas.
